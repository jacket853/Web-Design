# Web-Design
Some stuff I thought was cool/added to the site...
  1. Modal with card-type styling
  2. Dropdowns containing modal, large buttons
  3. "Home" and "About the Creator" go to independent pages, and can go back-and-forth so the user doesn't get lost
  4. Grid on both pages - strategic placing of sidebar on large screens and small screens on index.html
  5. Not really a "call to action," but blue-black-white color scheme and gentle corners draw attention to content
  6. External stylesheets (although the one for index.html is just for buttons, since I use them a good bit in this side)
    a. There is one from the internet which is just fonts
